## Objective
I am a researcher committed to pioneering advancements in cloud networking through the development of high-performance, secure, and intelligent networked systems. My research work centers on designing and optimizing programmable data plane architectures and kernel-level network stacks to achieve superior network performance. Additionally, I actively investigate security vulnerabilities in cloud-based networked systems and develop robust security mechanisms to ensure reliable and secure communications in dynamic cloud environments.
